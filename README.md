# SSML

SSML aims to impliment semi-supervised machine learning methods for Bioconductor
`SummarizedExperiment` class objects to predict labels of carcinogenicity.
However, we will write our methods to be sufficiently general so as to apply to
additional problems.

## Installation

You can install it with `BiocManager` as follows.

``` r
BiocManager::install("schifferl/SSML")
```
